## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React.js, Node.js, Tailwind

This app utilized a lot of components to keep the code simple and easy to read. Components were reused as much as possible with state changes creating some of the differences needed in various spots.

## Lessons Learned:

Something I learned here was mapping the various fields in the forms with the `onChange` event, otherwise the selections weren't properly saving.
